Essential Resources Directory
=============================

Place the Essential project assets in this folder.

Required file types:
- `.pins`
- `.pont`
- `.pprj`

Update the `.pprj` file name in `essential_open_api/config.py` by editing the variable:

```
PPRJ_FILENAME = "essential_baseline_6_20.pprj"
```

Set it to match the `.pprj` file you add here so the application can load the project correctly.
